# react-redux-sans-jsx

> A work in progress

A following along of react-redux todo example from the react-redux docs
without the JSX calls and instead using [jsnox](https://github.com/af/JSnoX) in
place instead.. also [uuid](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid) used rather
than just `int`s.

Not a 1-to-1, structure is simplied and contrived. Just the basic reducers
composition, component composition, and actions.

Also, using browserify rather than webpack.  ES2015 gulpfile and browserify.
